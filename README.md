# Ravi's Data Visualization Portfolio

You can see this work on https://maramravichandra.github.io/ravi-portfolio/

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio! My nickname is RaviM.

This project showcases my skills in creating data visualizations using Python, specifically with the `matplotlib` library. The portfolio is built as a static website using Quarto.

## About This Project

This portfolio includes examples of different types of charts generated with Python:
*   A line chart showing sine and cosine waves.
*   A bar chart displaying categorical data.

Each visualization is generated from a Python code block embedded within a Quarto (`.qmd`) document, which is then rendered into an HTML website.

## How to Run This Project

To render the website and see the portfolio on your local machine, you will need to have Quarto and Python installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ravi-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You will need `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

3.  **Render the site:**
    From the root of the project directory, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    quarto render
    ```
    This will generate the `index.html` file. You can then open this file in your web browser to view the portfolio.
